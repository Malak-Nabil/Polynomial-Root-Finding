# Polynomial Root Finding
This repository contains a C++ program designed to find the roots of polynomial equations provided in string format. The program supports polynomials up to the fifth order, allowing users to input equations directly as strings for root calculation.


## Usage
#### Input Format
Polynomials are entered as strings in the following format:

       ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f = 0

Replace a, b, c, d, e, f with the coefficients of the polynomial.

Terms with zero coefficients are set to zero can't be omitted.
